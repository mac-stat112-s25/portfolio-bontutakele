title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Humidity and Temperature Measurements at 9am, 2020-2022, in Hobart, Ulruru, and Wollongong"
ggplot(weather, aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = temp9am), col = "orange", size = .3) +
  geom_point(aes(y = humidity9am), size = .5) +
  facet_wrap(~ location) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Date at Measurement", y = "Humidity (%)/Temperature(C) at 9am")
```
