title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
```


```{r}
#|fig-cap: "Avergae SAT Scores of Each State vs. The Expense per Student, Categorized by Percentage of Students Taking the SAT"
ggplot(education, aes(x= sat, y = expend, col = fracCat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "% of SAT Students", labels = c("0-15%","15-45%","45-100%")) +
  labs(x = "Average SAT Score", y = "Expense per Student") +
  theme_bw() 
```
