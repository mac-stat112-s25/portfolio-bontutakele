title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
#|fig-cap: "Number of Hikes in Each Rating in the High Peaks Dataset"
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Difficult Rating of Hikes", y = "Number of Hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```
