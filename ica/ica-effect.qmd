## Exercise 1: Professionalism

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point()
```


# Part a
```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9am (C)", y = "Temperature at 3pm (C)", title = "Temperatures at 9am and 3pm (C) by Location", color = "Location")  
```

# Part b
Point plot of temperatures at 9am and 3pm in 3 locations in Australia
```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9am (C)", y = "Temperature at 3pm (C)", title = "Temperatures at 9am and 3pm (C) by Location", color = "Location")  
```
Point plot of temperatures at 9am and 3pm in 3 locations in Australia


## Exercise 2: Accessibilty

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "3pm temperature (Celsius)")  
```
